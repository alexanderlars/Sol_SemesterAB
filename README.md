# Sol & Semester AB - Travel Agency Web Shop

## Project Overview
**Sol & Semester AB** is a multi-page web shop developed as an individual final project for the **Web Design (WD501FST25)** course at **Kristianstad University** (Högskolan Kristianstad).
Designed for a fictional travel agency, the project focuses on selling family-friendly vacation packages to sunny destinations. The primary goal of this assignment was to plan, design, and develop a fully responsive website using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and the **Bootstrap** framework. The resulting site demonstrates semantic markup, consistent styling, and adherence to web accessibility standards.

## Key Features
* **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop using Bootstrap grid and utilities.
* **Navigation:** Consistent and accessible navigation bar across all pages.
* **Home Page:** Welcoming hero section (Jumbotron), introduction, and Call-to-Action (CTA).
* **Destination Listings:** A product listing page displaying various travel destinations using card layouts.
* **Product Details:** Individual pages for specific destinations containing detailed descriptions, images, and "Add to Cart" functionality.
* **Shopping Cart:** A dedicated page displaying selected trips.
* **Checkout & Payment:** A simulated payment flow.
* **Contact & Feedback:** A contact form with a confirmation/feedback page upon submission.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure (Header, Main, Footer, Article, Section, Nav).
* **CSS3:** Custom styling for specific design elements, colors, and typography.
* **Bootstrap 5:** Used for the core grid system, responsive navbar, cards, carousel, and forms.
* **WAVE Tool:** Used to validate accessibility (contrast, alt-tags, headings).

## Design & UX
The design philosophy centers on a **"Family & Sun"** theme, inspired by major travel agencies like *TUI* and *Apollo*.

* **Color Palette:**
    * *Ocean Blue:* Used for headers and primary buttons to evoke the sea.
    * *Sand Yellow:* Used for accents to represent the beach.
    * *White/Light Gray:* Used for backgrounds to create a clean, open, and airy feeling.
* **Typography:** Soft, legible fonts chosen to maintain a friendly and welcoming tone.
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Strong use of contrast and spacing to guide the user's eye from inspiration to booking.
* **Methodology:** A hybrid approach using Bootstrap classes for structure and a separate external CSS file for custom branding and overrides.

## Reflection & Learning Outcomes
This project provided hands-on experience in:
* Integrating a CSS framework (Bootstrap) while maintaining custom design control.
* Translating wireframes into functional code.
* Structuring a multi-page site with semantic HTML.
* Validating code and ensuring accessibility using tools like PageSpeed Insights and WAVE.
